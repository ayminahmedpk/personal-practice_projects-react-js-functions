React strict mode mounts components twice (mount->unmount->mount). This happens
only during development and only during strictmode. This is done to help you
find bugs and memory leaks (effects without good cleanup, basically).

Obviously, this drastically effects the amount of logs generated by useEffect
due to the extra mount/unmount step.

To avoid this, simply don't use strict mode.

If you want to use strict mode and avoid this regardless, either use the hack
(using ref, with its .current storint true/false), or use some kind of global
state to make/keep track of calls / cleanup.



The simpler option is to just not use strict mode when testing out effects with
the component lifecycle.



Also, note that order of effects matters.
